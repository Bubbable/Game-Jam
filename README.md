Title: Funny Bone
Contributers: Kevin Hacene - Programmer, Tyler Lin - Artist, Eric Belisle - Programmer

Description: Funny Bone is a simple 2D platformer where you play as a skull and the point of getting to the top is getting the joke. Unfortunately the game is not finished and we were not able to implement the joke
but, the game is pretty funny to watch others play since it is pretty difficult and hard to grasp. It is a fodian type game so it does make sense that it is difficult. Other things that we wanted to implement were
traps, a title screen, a win screen, and the jokes.
